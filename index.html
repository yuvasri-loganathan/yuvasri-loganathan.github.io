        <p>Hi everyone, I'm Yuvasri Loganathan, a full-time product analyst specializing in SaaS products, committed to driving digitalization for businesses.</p>

        <p>I find product development incredibly fulfilling.  I love using design thinking and creative problem-solving to address user needs.</p>

        <p>My daily tasks involve:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> Building product roadmaps to chart the course for future development.</li>
            <li> Conducting user research to understand the target audience deeply.</li>
            <li> Ideating the product workflow, taking it from vision to design.</li>
            <li> Writing product requirement documents (PRDs) to ensure clarity for development teams.</li>
            <li> Collaborating across various departments, including developers, testers, designers, and even the digital marketing team.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>My expertise covers various tools  like Jira,Excel for tasks tracking,PowerPoint for presentations, and design tools like Miro and Figma to translate ideas into visuals.</p>
        <p>This passion for collaboration led me to create Notion templates, specifically designed to help product managers achieve their OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) and streamline their daily tasks.
            In addition to my day job, I write insightful content on product management on this platform and LinkedIn.</p>
